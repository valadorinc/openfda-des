#Pool1 Submission#
A. assigned one leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted
Valador follows the Agile Scrum methodology for design and development.  During the kick-off meeting for this Project, Valador assigned Kevin Sadeghian as the Product owner, then worked to define the scope of the project based on the RFQ content.  Mr. Sadeghian is a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) and was provided with the authority and responsibility to complete the Project; and was held accountable for the quality and timeliness of the final prototype and accompanying artifacts.

B. assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum three of the labor categories limited to the Design Pool Labor categories to design the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services.
Valador assembled a team which included the following Labor Categories:

Labor Category	GSA Labor Category	Name
Product Manager	Program Manager	Kevin Sadeghian
Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester	Senior Developer	Philip Stroh
Visual Designer	Software Engineer	Paulo Ordoveza
Front End Web Developer	Developer	Philip Stroh, Paulo Ordoveza

Each of these individuals has different skillsets and varying years of experience. The resource estimates for each team member were calculated, factored into the project budget, documented in the project PMP and approved by Valador’s CEO to ensure availability throughout the project.
Additionally, Valador set up workspace for the duration of the project in one of our conference rooms.  The room was equipped with four computers (each with two monitors), a projector, and two whiteboards.  For the majority of the Project the team worked in the conference room and held all Sprint related meetings in the same workspace.  This allowed problems to be solved quickly and developers to collaborate when they ran into a roadblock.  This was especially important for this Project given the short duration.  Mr. Franzini was working remotely from out of state so the team utilized Webex meetings and teleconferences. 

c. understand what people need, by including people (see note #1) in the prototype design process
Immediately following the kick-off meeting, Valador held a brief focus group with five employees who were present in the office but not involved in the project to understand what people need (1) and determine how the openFDA data could be used.  The Project team explained the available data sets and asked the focus group what they would find useful in a system.  Several possible ideas came from the group and throughout the meeting a consensus was reached that the reactionRX was the most appropriate and useful application for the group; additionally, these same employees (focus group / Stakeholders) evaluated the User Interface mock-ups and suggested changes that would make it easier to use and more visually appealing during the first sprint review, once a Minimum Viable Product was available.

d. used at least three “human-centered design” techniques or tools
In addition to the focus group mentioned above, Valador involved a number of users in the prototype design to incorporate their feedback to design possible experience use cases from start to finish (2).  Our goal was to make a user-friendly prototype.  We interviewed users to gather real feedback. 
e. created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library
Valador used our internal style guide to develop the design and related artifacts. Our design team focused on creating a simple and intuitive design (3) which was later validated through usability testing and additional focus group sessions. 
f. used at least three modern (see Note#2) and open source frontend or client side (see note #3) web technologies
Valador has made use of the following technologies during this project:
•	Bootstrap
•	Google Charts
•	JQuery
•	AngularJS

g. performed usability tests with people
During the design phase, Valador performed usability testing with the same group of 5 people/stakeholders who participated in the focus group study following the kick-off meeting.  The group was asked to evaluate the Design prototype for usability and provided feedback that was implemented in the design and development phases of the project.  The project team frequently involved these stakeholders/people, specifically during sprint planning, sprint reviews, and ad-hoc as needed, in order to continuously have a clear understanding of their needs and requirements; feedback received from the focus groups was used in planning and development efforts.

h. used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
Valador followed our design approach which is based on the Agile Scrum methodology.  This included three Sprints which allowed us to iterate through various design and functionality enhancements; additionally, given the short timeframe of the project, feedback was solicited from both team members and other Valador employees throughout all sprints.  This feedback was implemented in the design and functional features that were developed in all sprints.  The Product Owner was responsible for engaging stakeholders/people and communicating the feedback to the development team.

i. created a prototype that works on multiple devices and presents a responsive design
Valador created a design prototype that works on any device with a web browser. Due to the short development timeframe, only Google Chrome for desktop browsers and Safari on iOS devices were tested.    The design prototype incorporates responsive design, which allows the prototype to work on mobile devices with any size screen, as long as the device is running a compatible browser. 


j. provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
Valador included an installation guide:  See [Github document](https://github.com/valadorinc/openfda-pool1/blob/master/docs/InstallGuide_pool1.txt). 

k. prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.
The prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.  Valador deployed the application making use of open licensed services such as Google Charts, GitHub, and DailyMed (dailymed.nlm.nih.gov).  Platforms used in the development include Bootstrap, AngularJS, PHP, Java, and Linux.
