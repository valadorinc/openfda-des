###(A) Assign A Leader
Valador follows the Agile Scrum methodology for design and development.  During the kick-off meeting for this Project, Valador assigned Kevin Sadeghian as the Product Owner, then worked to define the scope of the project based on the RFQ content.  Mr. Sadeghian is a Certified Scrum Product Owner and was given the authority and responsibility to complete the Project; and was held accountable for the quality and timeliness of the final prototype and accompanying artifacts.

###(B) Multidisciplinary Team
Valador assembled a team of Valador employees with different skillsets and varying years of experience:

|Labor Category|GSA Labor Category|Name|
|---|---|---|
|Product Manager|Program Manager|Kevin Sadeghian|
|Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester|Senior Developer|Philip Stroh|
|Visual Designer|Software Engineer|Paulo Ordoveza|
|Front End Web Developer|Developer|Philip Stroh, Paulo Ordoveza|

The resource estimates for each were factored into the project budget, documented in the project PMP and approved by Valadorâ€™s CEO to ensure availability.

Valador set up workspace for the duration of the project in one of our conference rooms with four workstations, a projector, and a whiteboard.  The team worked in the conference room which allowed problems to be solved quickly through [collaboration](https://github.com/valadorinc/openfda-pool1/tree/master/docs/Team%20Collaboration). Mr. Franzini was working remotely so the team utilized Skype, Webex meetings, and teleconferences to include him in the collaborative process. 

###(C) User-Centric Prototype Design Process
Immediately following the kick-off meeting, Valador held a [focus](https://github.com/valadorinc/openfda-pool1/blob/master/docs/App%20Design%20Focus%20Groups.docx?raw=true) group with five employees who were present in the office but not involved in the project to understand what people need and determine how the openFDA data could be used.  The Project team explained available data sets and asked the focus group what they would find useful.  Several possible ideas were suggested and throughout the meeting a consensus was reached that the reactionRX was the most appropriate and useful application for the group; additionally, these same employees (focus group / Stakeholders) evaluated the User Interface mock-ups and suggested changes that would make it easier to use and more visually appealing during the first sprint review, once a Minimum Viable Product was available.

###(D) Human-Centered Design Techniques
In addition to the focus group mentioned above, Valador involved a number of users in the prototype design to incorporate their feedback to design possible experience use cases from start to finish.  Our goal was to make a user-friendly prototype.  We interviewed users to gather real feedback. 
###(E) Design Style Guide
Valador used our internal style guide to develop the design and related artifacts. Our design team focused on creating a simple and intuitive design which was later validated through usability testing and additional focus group sessions. 

###(F) Frontend or Client Side Technologies
Valador has made use of the following technologies during this project:
*	Bootstrap
*	Google Charts
*	JQuery
*	AngularJS

###(G) Usability Tests
During the design phase, Valador performed usability testing with the group of 5 people/stakeholders who participated in the [focus group](https://github.com/valadorinc/openfda-pool1/blob/master/docs/App%20Design%20Focus%20Groups.docx?raw=true) study following the kick-off meeting.  The group was asked to evaluate the Design prototype for usability and provided feedback that was implemented in the design and development phases of the project.  The project team frequently involved these stakeholders/people, specifically during sprint planning, sprint reviews, and ad-hoc as needed, in order to gain a clear understanding of their needs and requirements.

###(H) Interactive Approach
Valador followed our design approach based on the Agile Scrum methodology.  This included three Sprints which allowed us to iterate through various design enhancements; additionally, given the short timeframe of the project, feedback was solicited from both team members and other Valador employees throughout all sprints.  This feedback was implemented in the design and functional features that were developed in all sprints.  The Product Owner was responsible for engaging stakeholders/people and communicating the feedback to the development team.

###(I) Multiple Device Compatibility Using Responsive Design
Valador created a design prototype that works on any device with a web browser. Due to the short development timeframe, only Google Chrome for desktop browsers and Safari on iOS devices were tested.    The design prototype incorporates responsive design, which allows the prototype to work on mobile devices with any size screen, as long as the device is running a compatible browser. 

###(J) Installation Documentation
Valador included an installation guide:  See [Github document](https://github.com/valadorinc/openfda-pool1/blob/master/docs/InstallGuide_pool1.txt). 

###(K) Openly Licensed Prototype and Platforms 
The prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.  Valador deployed the application making use of open licensed services such as Google Charts, GitHub, and DailyMed (dailymed.nlm.nih.gov).  Platforms used in the development include Bootstrap, AngularJS, PHP, Java, and Linux.
